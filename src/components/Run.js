                    <p>
                        I grew up in a small village in India üáÆüá≥ where <strong>running marathons and fitness awareness</strong> were not
                        a common part of life. Despite this, I pursued my education, moved to the city for higher studies, and later
                        worked with leading corporates. A freelancing opportunity eventually brought me to London two years ago,
                        where I now work as a software engineer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Running has always been close to my heart. Back in <strong>2021, I participated in the TCS Open 10K Marathon</strong>, which
                        sparked my dream of completing a full marathon. Now, I‚Äôm preparing to run the <strong>2025 TCS London Marathon</strong>, a
                        goal I‚Äôve cherished for years. When I didn‚Äôt secure a spot through the ballot, I decided to run for <strong>Ability
                        Bow</strong>, a cause that deeply resonates with me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Ability Bow</strong> is a charity gym in East London that provides tailored exercise programs for
                        individuals with disabilities or long-term health conditions, empowering them to regain independence and
                        improve their quality of life. This mission is personal to me. My <strong>70-year-old mother struggled with arthritis</strong>
                        for over a decade, and only after her knee surgery last year did she find relief. Her journey showed me how
                        vital accessible fitness solutions are for those facing similar challenges.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This marathon is about much more than running; it‚Äôs my way of giving back and honoring the
                        resilience of people like my mother. Over the years, I‚Äôve <strong>logged over 1,000 kilometers</strong> on the <strong>Nike Run app</strong> and,
                        with guidance from an ultra-marathon runner at my gym, I‚Äôm building my pace for this monumental challenge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, this journey isn‚Äôt just about running; it‚Äôs also about raising funds. <strong>This is my first
                        time fundraising</strong>, and it‚Äôs been much harder than I imagined üòì So far, I‚Äôve raised <strong>¬£75</strong>, but I still
                        have a long way to go. <strong>Every donation, no matter the size, brings me closer to my goal</strong>. Even <strong>¬£16 can make a big
                        difference</strong> and get me <strong>1% closer</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To encourage support, <strong>I‚Äôm willing to match your generosity</strong> - for every donation you make, I‚Äôll
                        contribute the same amount. If you donate <strong>¬£50</strong>, I‚Äôll add another <strong>¬£50</strong> from my side. This is my way of showing how
                        much this means to me and the people we‚Äôre helping together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Running this marathon in London, a city that has become my second home, is a surreal and fulfilling
                        experience. Growing up in a place where marathons weren‚Äôt part of the culture, achieving this dream feels
                        incredible. But <strong>I can‚Äôt do it alone. I need your support to make this dream a reality.</strong>
